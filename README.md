Honestly spaghetti code but does the job. Created 24th May.

The clock (index.html/renderer.js/styles.css) is always on top in the top right of your screen.
The date & time can be clicked through so that you can still close tabs and such. 

The reminders window (reminders.html/reminders.js/reminders.css) can be opened by clicking the white square below the time.
The reminders window has a simple reminders app inside it that notifies you of your reminders 60 minutes, 30 minutes, 5 minutes, and at the time of your reminder to the left of the date of the clock and plays a sound effect (piano key (d)).

Also in the reminders window is a textarea that is saved to local storage.
